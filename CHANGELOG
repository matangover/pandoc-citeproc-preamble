# Version 1.2.2 (2016-12-22) #

* Delete LTS Haskell cabal.config.

pandoc-citeproc-preamble is tested and working with pandoc 1.19 and
pandoc-citeproc 0.10.3.  However, to use these versions, you need to
compile pandoc-citeproc-preamble against pandoc-types 1.17.  The
existing cabal.config was making that more difficult.

# Version 1.2.1 (2016-11-10) #

* Bump version in pandoc-citeproc-preamble.cabal.
* Bump resolver in README.md.

# Version 1.2.0 (2016-11-10) #

* Bump LTS Haskell version to 7.8.

# Version 1.1.0 (2016-02-23) #

* Bump LTS Haskell version to 5.4 by means of cabal.config file.
  This should fix SoftBreak errors.
* Don't insert a preamble if pandoc-citeproc inserted no bibliographic
  entries.

# Version 1.0.0 (2015-09-26)

* Initial release.
